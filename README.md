## Welcome to our GitHub for the Carlson MSBA 6330 Trends Marketplace project! 

Our project focuses on TIBCO, which offers an array of low- or no-code products for data analysis and visualization. TIBCO products integrate with many big data technologies, including Apache Kafka to offer streaming analytics capabilities. TIBCO software can be leveraged on premises, managed with Docker and Kubernetes, or it can be spun up to the cloud on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

In this GitHub, we include a copy of our presentation (full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIoAfFUjTc), flyer, and a detailed walk-through of a streaming analytics use case with TIBCO (https://youtu.be/7Snkc7kl2p8).  

If you have questions, please feel free to email us. You can also find out more information about TIBCO and their products at https://www.tibco.com/. Happy analyzing!
